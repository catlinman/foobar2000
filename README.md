## Installation ##

If at any point you make changes to the interface and wish to reset: There's
an included layout file in the theme directory called *NekoRoX.fcl* which you
can load via *ColumnsUI* to reset everything to the way it was intended.

Once you have completed the steps further below, make sure to install the fonts
included in the *fonts* directory.

### Standard ###

If you have the standard non-portable version of Foobar2000 installed: make
sure to copy the *smoothbrowser*, *configuration* and *user-components*
folders to your application data directory located at *%appdata%/foobar2000*.

Additionally, copy the *themes* directory to your root Foobar2000 installation directory.

### Portable ###

With the portable installation simply copy all the files in this directory to
you root Foobar2000 installation directory.

I did not create nor do I own any of the plugins and scripts included in this
setup. For the respective creators please view the comments and descriptions of
the plugins and scripts included.

This is a heavily modified fork of the CaTRoX theme by eXtremeHunter1972. I
take no credit for any of the underlying original code and styling. Credit for
that goes entirely to the original creator.

Furthermore, the newest version implements a lot of [TheQwertiest](https://github.com/TheQwertiest) work with his [CaTRoX branch](https://github.com/TheQwertiest/CaTRoX_QWR/). I've merged a plethora of his code into my version of the theme to make what is hopefully the most elaborate and straight forward setup so far.
